# One Time Pad
If a randomly generated keyword (that is at least as long as the message) is
used then the cipher will be rendered uncrackable as it is possible to decode
the cipher text into anything.

## Flaws
The security of the cipher relies on the key having certain properties:
- it must be completely random
- it must never repeat
- it must not be used more than once
