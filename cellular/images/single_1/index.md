Here are images representing the evolution of each rule sorted into sets.  

*Note: As these automata are infinite in width, accurately representing them in
the finite space of computer memory is impossible; As such, there are several
images which include erroneous structures entering from the sides.  
I have left these images intact, however, I will be focusing on the central two
quaters of each image.*

Set | Rules of interest | Description
----|-------------------|------------
1   | 151, 183          | Quickly becomes static
1b  |                   | Alternates between all live and all dead cells
2   | 169               | A 45° slope  moving to the left
2b  |                   | A slope (22.5° ?) moving to the left
3   |                   | A vertical line
4   | 107, 225          | A 45° slope  moving to the right
4b  |                   | A slope (22.5° ?) moving to the right
5   |                   | Sierpiński triangles
5b  | 150               | Other Sierpiński-like triangles
6   |                   | Right angle triangles, left side
7   | 73                | Right angle triangles, central
8   |                   | Right angle triangles, right side
