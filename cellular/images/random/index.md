Here are images representing the evolution of each rule sorted into sets.  

*Note: As these automata are infinite in width, accurately representing them in
the finite space of computer memory is impossible; As such, there are several
images which include erroneous structures entering from the sides.  
I have left these images intact, however, I will be focusing on the central two
quaters of each image.*

Set | Rules of interest | Description
----|-------------------|------------
1   |                   | Quickly becomes static
1c  |                   | Wave like patterns
2   |                   | 45° slopes moving to the left
2b  |                   | A slope (22.5° ?) moving to the left
2c  | 169               | 45° slopes moving to the left, with patterns
2d  |                   | 45° slopes moving mostly to the left
3   |                   | vertical lines
3c  | 73, 109           | vertical lines, with intermixed patterns
4   | 75, 225           | A 45° slope  moving to the right
4b  |                   | A slope (22.5° ?) moving to the right
10  | 90, 150           | Many triangles raining downwards
10b |                   | Many triangles pointing up-right
10c |                   | Many triangles pointing up-left
11  |                   | Lines moving both left and right
