# sudoq

**[b701f1b][]**  
The sudoku grid is stored as an array of rows with functions to convert to
cols/boxes when the grid is checked for validity.

The grid is displayed in the terminal via ncurses. Basic usage is easy to
understand, however it may be possible to create a more efficient system if I
study more.
