## readmes
__(added: 2020-07-17, completed: ...)__

I should add readmes with a unified format:
- program name
- short description
- basic example
- dependancies

## changelogs
__(added: 2020-07-17, completed: ...)__

It could be helpful to keep track of changes?
I would need a version/release system?

## documentation
__(added: 2020-07-17, completed: ...)__

Documentation could be helpful

## libraries
__(added: 2020-07-17, completed: ...)__  

I have pulled some code out into libraries (fio, xdg, etc.), each repo should
be updated to use these libraries instead of bundling code?  
I might move the opengl code into a library instead of reusing it so often.  

*Making the code in these libraries as concise and efficient as possible should
be a goal.*

## unit tests and performance analysis
__(added: 2020-07-17, completed: ...)__

Especially for libraries, but also for programs.

## cross platform code
__(added: 2020-07-17, completed: ...)__

I am currently only compiling and testing on Linux. Most of these programs
should compile for Windows (and Mac?) as is, others may require some changes?
